## Title: Your UNC Icon

# Description: 
Our project is a quiz that tells users what their UNC icon character is. Possible characters include Kris Jordan, Gary the preacher, the bell tower, Ramses the ram, and Kevin G. 

# Programming concepts
list: We used list to store types of return statements in order to be able to display on our return page a picture and a blurb of text.
if and elif statements: These allowed us to add points to different indiiduals for different questions.
parameters: These allowed us to use functions for different questions
function definitions: These allowed us to differentiate questions and add points in each different question.
importing: Allowed us to use variable and functions between files

# Challenges:
